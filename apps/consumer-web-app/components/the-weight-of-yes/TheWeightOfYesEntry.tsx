/**
 * The Weight of Yes's persistent card on Home.
 *
 * The pop-up gets one showing per login. This is the permanent, un-timed
 * way in for as long as the assignment is open, exactly as every other
 * experience in this app pairs an interruption with a card that never goes
 * away until the thing is done.
 *
 * Renders nothing once the sitting is finished, and nothing for a member
 * who was never assigned it. Both decisions are made upstream, in
 * lib/the-weight-of-yes/service.ts, so this component has one job and no
 * rules of its own.
 *
 * IT CARRIES THE ASSIGNMENT'S DELIVERY RECEIPT (migration 210), for the
 * reason the cards beside it carry their own: the pop-up gets one showing,
 * and a receipt that only counted the pop-up would let a coach's screen say
 * "they have not seen it" about a member who has looked at this card every
 * morning. This is an assessment_assignments row like every other coach
 * assignment, so it uses the one receipt system.
 *
 * IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT ANY OTHER EXPERIENCE, and it never can: it is
 * handed an assignment id and whether a draft exists, and neither of those
 * carries the follow-up. The adaptation is one question's wording, deeper
 * in, and it is invisible from here.
